DataSpark: Illuminating Insights for Global Electronics
</h1>

### Project Objective
The objective is to provide insights from dataset of Global Electronics, a leading retailer of consumer electronics, and actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction, optimize operations, and drive overall business growth. 

### Approach
  1.	Cleansing the datasets of the company received by suitably handling the null values, missing values, data type conversions, duplicate values and so on.
  
  2.	Storing the cleaned data in MySql database
     
  3.	Merging the datasets into a comprehensive dataset & storing that also in MySql database
  
  4.	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns, and insights.
  
  5.	Represent the insights visually using Power BI tool   and
  
  6.	Provide results through SQL queries 


#### Exploratory data analysis

Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s , EDA is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods.
EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques considered for data analysis are appropriate. 
EDA helps determine how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need, making it easier for data scientists to discover patterns, spot anomalies, test a hypothesis, or check assumptions.

### Technologies used and Pre-requisites

All details and installation information are provided in the Prerquisite.PDF file.

1.	**Python:** The programming language used for building the application and scripting tasks.

    Visit the URL  [Download Python | Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)    to download and install python in the PC

    **Install necessary Python packages / Libraries:** Install the necessary packages / libraries using pip or conda package manager. Required libraries include DateTime, Regex, Streamlit, Pandas, mysql-connector-python and google-api-python-client

2.	**Streamlit:** Streamlit is an open-source Python framework designed to create and share web applications. It is specifically built for Python, making it easy for data scientists and machine learning engineers to deploy their models and visualize data without needing extensive knowledge of web development.
	
        A web-based user interface is developed using Streamlit for Sql queries & result display.

3.	**Power BI:** It is an interactive data visualization software product developed by Microsoft with a primary focus on business intelligence1. Power BI is part of the Microsoft Power Platform.
	  	
4.	**MySql DB:**  is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and manipulate databases.

     Search web for MYSQL database installation and install the same in the PC.

     MySQL database is used to store the retrieved data for more structured querying.
  	
5.	**SQL queries:** (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. SQL queries are commands used to interact with databases to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data. They are essential for data management and analysis tasks
	
     SQL queries are used to analyse data and extract meaningful insights for the predefined options in this project.

### Executing the Application 

go through and run the project, follow these steps:

1.	Install Python and required packages / libraries as given above
2.	Install MySQL and have its login credentials for storing the data.
3.	Install Power BI desktop  or link to online version following instructions in Mircrosft site for Power BI.
4.	Download the Python Application Script Jag_DataSpark_proj.py from Git hub.
5.	Launch the Application through Jupyter lab's Terminal (Windows Powershell) typing.  
     **Python Jag_DataSpark_proj.py**

### Features

The application offers the following features:
+	Cleansing & storing (in MySql) the given dataset/s.
+	Merging Datasets as FinalMerged and storing it in MySql for Power BI visualization and query analysis.
+	Data analysis and visualization through charts and graphs using Power BI.
+	Analysis of details from SQL database using SQL queries for a ten different pre-defined search options.
